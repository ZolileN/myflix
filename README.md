# MyFlix - A Netflix clone built on rails.

This was the final project that I worked on for Tealeaf Academy. This course focused on Test Driven Development (TDD) and I got to learn and utilize all kinds of new skills and technologies, such as RSpec, Capybara, Selenium, VCR, and a whole slew of testing techniques. I also got to integrate with 3rd party APIs such as MailGun, AWS S3, and Stripe for credit card processing. Lastly, I got to learn about moving beyond the typical MVC structure of smaller Rails apps and onto refactoring complex logic into objects.

##Testing Out the Application
###As a regular user
You can either sign up using the special fake credit card: “4242424242424242″ or you can sign in with the email address: “test@user.com” and the password: “user”.

###As an admin
You can sign in using the email address: “test@admin.com”, and the password: “admin”.
